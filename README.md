# Algo_issues
Used for recording some Algorithm and Leetcode problems that I've finished

## Linklist Questions list:
### Basic Method of Linklist:
    1.Linklist creation
    2.Print Linklist
    3.Adding nodes in Linklist
    4.remove nodes from Linklist based data input
    5.Linklist reverse

### Simple Algorithm Problem:
    1.Find the middle node in Linkelist
    2.Mergesort of Linklist
    3.Let odd values node in front of even values node
    4.Resort of Linklist
    5.Find first common node of two Linklist if they are joined by each other
    6.Judging if Linklist contains ring structure
    7.Find entry node of Linklist if has ring structure

### A Little Complicated Issue:
    1.Reverse list by couple
    2.Reverse list by input
